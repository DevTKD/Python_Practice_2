🧠 100 Python Practice Exercises Journey
A hands-on journey to Python mastery

🚀 About This Repo
Welcome! This repository documents my personal journey as I work through all the challenges in the book "100 Exercises for Practicing Python". This project is part of my ongoing mission to sharpen my skills as a backend Python developer and build a rock-solid coding foundation 💪🏾🐍.

Rather than just reading or passively watching tutorials, I'm doing the work — problem by problem, day by day.

🎯 Purpose
    🧩 Practice Over Theory: This repo is 100% focused on practical coding — each file is a standalone exercise solution.
    📈 Skill Progression: Exercises are ordered by difficulty and topic to build fluency over time.
    🛠️ Real-World Ready: Many problems mimic the kind of logic used in real software engineering tasks.
    🧪 No Hiding: Every bug, mistake, and lesson is part of the journey.

🧭 Learning Milestones
    ✅ Core Python syntax
    ✅ Loops, conditionals, and functions
    ✅ String & list manipulations
    ✅ File I/O
    ✅ Error handling
    ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    ✅ Algorithmic thinking

🔥 Why I'm Doing This
I believe great developers aren’t born — they’re built one exercise at a time.
This project isn't just about solving problems — it's about transforming how I think, debug, and design Python code.
